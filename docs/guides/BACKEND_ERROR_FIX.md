# ✅ Backend Error Fixed!

## 🎉 Issue Resolved

The backend TypeScript path alias error has been successfully fixed!

---

## ❌ The Problem

```
Error: Cannot find module '@/config'
```

**Root Cause:** TypeScript path aliases (`@/config`, `@/modules`, etc.) were defined in `tsconfig.json` but weren't being resolved when running the compiled JavaScript code.

---

## ✅ The Solution

### 1. Installed `tsc-alias`
```bash
npm install --save-dev tsc-alias
```

### 2. Updated Build Script
Modified `package.json`:
```json
"build": "tsc && tsc-alias"
```

This ensures that after TypeScript compilation, `tsc-alias` resolves all path aliases to relative paths in the compiled JavaScript.

### 3. Rebuilt the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Started the Server
```bash
npm start
```

## 🚀 Backend Now Running!

## 🔧 How It Works

### TypeScript Path Aliases
In `tsconfig.json`:
```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["*"],
  "@/config/*": ["config/*"],
  "@/modules/*": ["modules/*"],
  "@/services/*": ["services/*"]
}
```

### After Build
`tsc-alias` converts these to relative paths in compiled JavaScript:
- `import from '@/config'` → `import from './config'`
- `import from '@/modules/user'` → `import from './modules/user'`

---

## 📝 Updated Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/server.ts",
    "build": "tsc && tsc-alias",      // ✅ Now includes path resolution
    "start": "node dist/server.js"
  }
}
```

---

## 🎯 What to Do Next

### Development Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Uses `nodemon` with TypeScript directly - hot reloads on changes.

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
Compiles TypeScript and runs the compiled JavaScript.

## 🔍 Testing the Backend

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## 📦 Dependencies Added

- **tsc-alias** (devDependency): Resolves TypeScript path aliases in compiled output
- **tsconfig-paths**: For runtime path resolution support

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always rebuild after tsconfig changes:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **For development, use:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This uses nodemon and ts-node, so no path alias issues.

3. **For production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

---

## 🎉 Success!

Both frontend and backend are now running without errors!

- **Frontend**: Compiled with warnings (unused variables - non-critical)
- **Backend**: ✅ Running perfectly on port 3000
